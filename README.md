Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple Python number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it.

How the Game Works

The player is asked for their name.

The program randomly chooses a number between 1 and 200.

The player has 6 attempts to guess the correct number.

After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess is too low or too high.

If the player guesses correctly, the game congratulates them.

After the game ends, the player can choose to play again.
